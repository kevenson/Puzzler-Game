Questions:

## How big do you feel in the space?

It feels pretty good/normal, I feel maybe a bit taller than normal, but not much. 
Scale of barrels seems right, but scale of room makes me feel a bit bigger. 

## Is there anything that is difficult to see or seems out of place?

Pretty comfortable. The lighting on the walls doesn't quite look like it's coming from the torches. 
The rings look good--they look like triggers of some type. 
The orbs/balls draw my attention but I'm not sure what they're for. 

## How would you describe the mood of the space? 

It feels dark, creepy, and old. I feel like there might be bodies or booze in the barrels.
