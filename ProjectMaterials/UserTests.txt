# User Test #1 - 
Jackie Brown

Questions:

## How big do you feel in the space?

It feels pretty good/normal, I feel maybe a bit taller than normal, but not much. 
Scale of barrels seems right, but scale of room makes me feel a bit bigger. 

## Is there anything that is difficult to see or seems out of place?

Pretty comfortable. The lighting on the walls doesn't quite look like it's coming from the torches. 
The rings look good--they look like triggers of some type. 
The orbs/balls draw my attention but I'm not sure what they're for. 

## How would you describe the mood of the space? 

It feels dark, creepy, and old. I feel like there might be bodies or booze in the barrels.

# User Test #2 - UI
Jackie Brown

Questions:

## Are you seeing a panel of some kind?

I do see a large panel with some instructions and what looks like a button, but I'm not sure how I click it.

## How large does the panel appear to be?

It's pretty big. It looks like it takes up the entire room, but it doesn't look massive or overbearing to me.

## What do you think this panel is for?

It's pretty clearly for starting the Puzzler game. 

## Can you tell what the button is for?

Starting the game.

## Click the button....can you tell what the next panel is for?

This one would be for restarting the game. Very similar panel with the same basic layout, just different text and 
a 'restart' button
