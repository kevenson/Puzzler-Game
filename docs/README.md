# The Puzzler

The Puzzler is a mobile VR game for Googld Cardboard that is modeled off of the old Simon electronic memory game. In this version, players begin in a dungeon on a mysterious island, and must solve memory puzzles in order to escape. 

The puzzles are created with five floating orbs that the user can interact with through gaze-based raycasting--once the orbs display a pattern by lighting up in sequence, the player must match the sequence to proceed.

## Outcomes

This was a practice project for me, as I learn to design better VR experiences. The particular emphases here were scaling models in VR, creating the desired mood through lighting effects and sound, UI design and avoiding motion/simulator sickness. 

With these goals in mind, the project was a success. I was able to build the game using Unity3D for Google Cardboard on Android, and my user tests (see below) suggest that the game hit all the desired notes. 

## Process

The first part of the process was to create a persona for the project--an imaginary person who I thought would be interested in this particular VR app. In other words, the persona is a a way of creating a user for our app before we've even started building it. Since we want to be able to ground our design questions throughout the process on our users and use-cases this is a very important first step. 
 
### Persona

#### Bob Loblaw
##### "If you can describe it, I can build it."

##### Age: 26

##### VR Experience: low

*Bob Loblaw is a 26 year old male living in Eugene, Oregon and working as a freelance web developer. Most of Bob's clients are US-based (generally small start-ups), and he has been making a comfortable living for the last few years with this business, enough that he was able to quit his day job. 

Bob loves experimenting with new technology, and is motivated by emerging trends. He likes to learn new things and to feel that he is "ahead of the curve." Recently he has begun experimenting with virtual reality, in part due to his interest in gaming, but also because he sees it playing a large role in web dev in the relatively near future. His experience is low, and he is mostly experimenting with VR games and reading up on emerging web platforms and standards like AFrame.*

### Sketches 

Next in the process we start sketching the environment we're envisioning for the app. I am a terrilble sketcher, so my sketches were pretty awful, but that doesn't matter here. The point is to rapidly test your general ideas for the app before you sink a lot of time into building them, in order to rapidly iterate and find the best general design. Once you have that, your sketches become a blueprint of sorts that will help you build your game or other app. 

I created several sketches, but this is the one I ended up going with for the Puzzler game:

Pretty simple, right? Still, even this very basic sketch helped me make important design decisions down the road.

My audience is mainly people who would like to learn more about developing VR experiences and are looking for "how-to" information.

Goals:
1. Write-up provides actionable information regarding how to create a simple VR experience, 
from start to finish.
2. Write-up explains how to use Google VR to create experience for Cardboard.
3. Write-up provides links for further learning.
