My audience is mainly people who would like to learn more about developing VR experiences and are looking for "how-to" information.

Goals:
1. Write-up provides actionable information regarding how to create a simple VR experience, 
from start to finish.
2. Write-up explains how to use Google VR to create experience for Cardboard.
3. Write-up provides links for further learning.

# The Puzzler

The Puzzler is a mobile VR game for Googld Cardboard that is modeled off of the old Simon electronic memory game. In this version, players begin in a dungeon on a mysterious island, and must solve memory puzzles in order to escape. 
The puzzles are created with five floating orbs that the user can interact with through gaze-based raycasting--once the orbs display a pattern by lighting up in sequence, the player must match the sequence to proceed.

## Outcomes

This was a practice project for me, as I learn to design better VR experiences. The particular emphases here were scaling models in VR, creating the desired mood through lighting effects and sound, UI design and avoiding motion/simulator sickness. 

With these goals in mind, the project was a success.
